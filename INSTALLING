drozer Installation
===================

To get drozer running you will need:

 * a PC
 * an Android device or emulator, running Android 2.1 (Eclair) or later

To get the most from drozer, your system will need a number of packages installed:

 * Java Development Kit (JDK)
 * Apache ANT
 * Android Software Development Kit (SDK)
 * Android Native Development Kit (NDK)

You should ensure that each of these is on your system path (you should be able
to execute ant, javac, dx and ndk-build).

Additionally, you should set an environment variable ANDROID_HOME that points
to your copy of the Android SDK.

Then, follow the instructions for your platform.

Note: before upgrading, you should remove all previous version of drozer or
      Mercury from your system. This will avoid potential problems with drozer
      using parts of the old codebase.


Linux
-----

Download the latest version of drozer from the project site (mwr.to/drozer),
these contain a Python .egg file to install drozer.

First, you need to install drozer's dependencies, which should be available in
your distributions package repository.

 * Python 2.7 with development headers
 * Python Setuptools

Then, install drozer's Python dependencies:

 $ easy_install --allow-hosts pypi.python.org protobuf==2.4.1
 $ easy_install twisted==10.2.0

Next, install drozer itself:

 $ easy_install ./drozer-2.3.0-py2.7.egg

To test the installation:

 $ drozer
 usage: drozer [COMMAND]

 $

Congratulations, you are ready to go.


Windows
-------

A Windows Installer is available for drozer, which builds a complete Python
environment on your PC with most of drozer's dependencies built in.

Before you start, make sure that you have the Java JDK installed, and your
JAVA_HOME environment variable points to this folder.

The drozer installation must be run as a Windows administrator.

To test the installation:

 > C:\Program Files\drozer\drozer.bat
 usage: drozer [COMMAND]
