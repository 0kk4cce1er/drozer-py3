Installing Mercury Console
==========================

The Mercury Console and Server should be installed on your PC. They are
implemented using Python, and have a few dependencies that must be met.

It is recommended that you use Python 2.7 to run Mercury.

Download the latest version of Mercury from the project site (mwr.to/mercury).
Mercury is available in the Python Egg format, or as an installer for Microsoft
Windows.

Follow the instructions for your platform.

Note: before upgrading, you should remove the previous version of Mercury from
your system. This will avoid potential problems with Mercury using parts of the
old codebase.
