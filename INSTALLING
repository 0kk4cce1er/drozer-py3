Installing Mercury Console
==========================

The Mercury Console and Server should be installed on your PC. They are implemented
using Python, and have a few dependencies that must be met.

It is recommended that you use Python 2.7 to run Mercury.

Download the latest version of Mercury from the project site (mwr.to/mercury).
Mercury is available in the Python Egg format, or as an installer for Microsoft
Windows.
